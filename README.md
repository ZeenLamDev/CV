## About Me
Recent graduate of the prestigious Bootcamp Makers. My passion for coding began once I had taken a couple of beginner courses in coding to be sure of my next career move. Makers Academy has accelerated my learning and has provided me with the tools and knowledge required to pursue my goals within the tech industry. 

A keen ambitious programmer aiming to provide a level head, drive and energy to a company with a supportive learning environment. Currently on the lookout for a full stack developer role working with interesting colleagues and new technologies.

## Skills 

- **Self Starter** - The most important skill picked up during my time at Makers is being **self sufficient** in starting new projects. Knowing how to implement user requirements with planning/diagramming and TDD has helped further my programming knowledge. My skill has been further developed by spending my weekends on solo challenges set by Makers with minimal instructions. I particularly enjoyed the Rock, paper, scissors game I created following the **MVC** structure based on Ruby. It was our first foray into web development and It was super interesting writing the logic for the game and having it visually represented on a browser.
<br>

- **Communication** - Equally adept at working by myself and **teamworking**, one of my previous roles was a bar manager. managing the bar team as well as the waiters/waitresses. Overseeing the daily operations of the restaurant & communicating to the team to ensure a smooth and efficient service for the team and guests.
<br>

- **Flexible** - I am open to switching roles, learning new skills/technologies and ways of working. I switched from an overseas sales position to a more technical operational role to gain a better understanding of behind the scenes. In that sense Makers has been a good fit for me as I'm keen on new challenges, pushing myself and taking the **initiative** in my own learning.
